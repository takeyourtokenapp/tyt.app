Each NFT miner represents actual mining capacity in professional data centers. You earn daily BTC rewards based on your miner's hashrate (TH/s), after electricity and maintenance fees are deducted."},{id:"gs-2",question:"How do I get started?",answer:"Getting started is simple: 1) Sign up for a free account, 2) Complete basic verification (KYC Level 0 for $100/day withdrawals), 3) Purchase your first NFT miner from the marketplace, 4) Start earning BTC rewards automatically. Your miner begins working immediately after purchase."},{id:"gs-3",question:"Do I need technical knowledge to use the platform?",answer:"No technical knowledge required! We handle all the technical aspects including mining hardware, electricity, cooling, maintenance, and network optimization. You simply own the NFT miner and collect rewards. Our platform is designed to be beginner-friendly with helpful guides and 24/7 support."},{id:"gs-4",question:"What cryptocurrencies does the platform support?",answer:"The platform supports multiple cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), TYT token (Solana), USDT, Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX), XRP, and TON. You can deposit with any supported crypto, and withdraw BTC rewards to your preferred blockchain network."}]},{id:"nft-miners",title:"NFT Miners",icon:y,questions:[{id:"nft-1",question:"What is an NFT miner and how does it generate rewards?",answer:"An NFT miner is a digital asset that represents real mining power (hashrate) in our partner data centers. Each NFT has specific specifications: TH/s (hashrate), W/TH (efficiency), region, and maintenance rate. The miner processes Bitcoin transactions 24/7, and you receive daily BTC rewards proportional to your share of the network."},{id:"nft-2",question:"Can I own multiple miners?",answer:"Yes! You can own unlimited NFT miners. Many users build diversified portfolios with different miner types, regions, and efficiency levels to optimize their returns and spread risk. Each miner operates independently and generates separate reward streams."},{id:"nft-3",question:"Can I upgrade my miner?",answer:"Yes, miners support two types of upgrades: 1) Hashrate upgrades - increase your TH/s to mine more Bitcoin, 2) Efficiency upgrades - reduce W/TH to lower electricity costs. Upgrades are purchased with TYT tokens and permanently improve your miner's performance."},{id:"nft-4",question:"What happens if my miner becomes unprofitable?",answer:"If Bitcoin price drops significantly or network difficulty increases dramatically, daily rewards may not cover maintenance fees. In this case, we provide a 30-day grace period where your miner remains active. You can: 1) Wait for market conditions to improve, 2) Add funds to cover maintenance, 3) Upgrade efficiency to reduce costs, or 4) Sell your miner on the marketplace."}]},{id:"rewards",title:"Rewards & Mining",icon:b,questions:[{id:"rew-1",question:"How are daily rewards calculated?",answer:"Daily rewards follow this formula: Gross BTC = (Your TH/s ÷ Network Hashrate) × Daily Block Rewards. Then we deduct: Electricity costs (based on W/TH × regional power price) + Service fee (varies by plan). Net BTC = Gross BTC - Costs. Rewards are automatically deposited to your wallet every 24 hours at midnight UTC."},{id:"rew-2",question:"When do I receive my mining rewards?",answer:"Mining rewards are calculated and distributed automatically every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC. You'll see your pending rewards update in real-time throughout the day, and the final payout is credited to your wallet at midnight. You can withdraw anytime after rewards are credited."},{id:"rew-3",question:"What affects my mining profitability?",answer:"Four main factors affect profitability: 1) Bitcoin price - higher price = more valuable rewards, 2) Network difficulty - lower difficulty = easier to mine, 3) Your miner's efficiency (W/TH) - lower = less electricity costs, 4) Regional electricity rates - data center location matters. Monitor these factors in your dashboard."},{id:"rew-4",question:"Can I reinvest my rewards automatically?",answer:"Yes! Enable auto-reinvest in your miner settings. You can set a percentage (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of daily rewards to automatically purchase additional TH/s. This compounds your mining power over time. You can adjust or disable auto-reinvest anytime."}]},{id:"maintenance",title:"Maintenance & Fees",icon:x,questions:[{id:"main-1",question:"What are maintenance fees and how do they work?",answer:"Maintenance fees cover electricity, cooling, hardware maintenance, and facility operations. Fees are calculated daily based on: 1) Your miner's power consumption (W/TH × TH/s), 2) Regional electricity rates, 3) Service fee (varies by VIP tier). Fees are automatically deducted from your daily BTC rewards before payout."},{id:"main-2",question:"How can I pay maintenance fees?",answer:"You can pay maintenance fees with three options: 1) TYT token (20% discount + automatic burn), 2) USDT (no discount), 3) Auto-deduct from BTC rewards (no discount). Paying with TYT is recommended for maximum savings and supports the token economy."},{id:"main-3",question:"What is the TYT discount system?",answer:"Paying maintenance with TYT tokens provides up to 20% discount based on your VIP tier: Bronze (2%), Silver (5%), Gold (9%), Platinum (13%), Diamond (18%), VIP (20%). All TYT used for maintenance is automatically burned, reducing total supply. The Service Button provides an additional 3% daily discount (resets every 24h)."},{id:"main-4",question:"What happens if I don't pay maintenance fees?",answer:"If daily rewards don't cover fees and you have insufficient balance, your miner enters a 30-day grace period. During this time: Your miner remains operational but rewards are held. You can add funds to clear the deficit, or sell your miner on the marketplace. After 30 days without payment, the miner is suspended until fees are paid."}]},{id:"wallet",title:"Wallet & Withdrawals",icon:v,questions:[{id:"wal-1",question:"What withdrawal networks are supported?",answer:"We support withdrawals to 8 networks: Bitcoin (mainnet), Lightning Network (instant, low fees), Liquid Network (fast, private), Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC on Ethereum), Solana, Tron, XRP, and TON. Each network has different speed and fee characteristics - choose based on your needs."},{id:"wal-2",question:"What are the withdrawal limits and fees?",answer:"Withdrawal limits depend on your KYC level: Level 0 ($100/day), Level 1 ($1,000/day), Level 2 ($10,000/day), Level 3 (Unlimited). Network fees vary: Bitcoin (0.0001 BTC), Lightning (<$0.01), Liquid (0.00001 BTC), wBTC (gas fees), Other networks (minimal). We use dynamic fee estimation for optimal confirmation times."},{id:"wal-3",question:"How long do withdrawals take?",answer:"Withdrawal times vary by network: Lightning Network (instant, <1 second), Liquid Network (2 minutes), Bitcoin mainnet (10-60 minutes, 1-6 confirmations), Ethereum/wBTC (5-15 minutes), Solana (30 seconds), Tron (3 minutes), XRP (3-5 seconds). First withdrawal per day may require additional security verification."},{id:"wal-4",question:"Is my wallet secure?",answer:"Yes! We use enterprise-grade security: 1) Fireblocks custody for institutional-level protection, 2) Multi-signature cold storage for offline funds, 3) Real-time blockchain monitoring, 4) 2FA/Passkey authentication required, 5) Withdrawal whitelist available, 6) Insurance coverage for platform funds. You can also connect external Web3 wallets."}]},{id:"kyc",title:"KYC & Verification",icon:T,questions:[{id:"kyc-1",question:"Why is KYC verification required?",answer:"KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is required for regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. It protects both users and the platform from money laundering, identity theft, and other illegal activities. All major crypto platforms require KYC for withdrawals above certain thresholds."},{id:"kyc-2",question:"What are the KYC verification levels?",answer:"We have 4 KYC levels: Level 0 (Email only, $100/day withdrawals), Level 1 (ID document, $1,000/day), Level 2 (ID + Selfie + Address proof, $10,000/day), Level 3 (Enhanced due diligence, Unlimited). Higher levels unlock larger withdrawal limits, marketplace access, and VIP benefits."},{id:"kyc-3",question:"How long does KYC verification take?",answer:"Verification times vary by level: Level 1 (5-15 minutes, automated), Level 2 (2-24 hours, manual review), Level 3 (1-3 business days, enhanced due diligence). Most users complete Level 1 instantly. We'll email you when verification is complete or if additional documents are needed."},{id:"kyc-4",question:"What documents do I need for KYC?",answer:"Required documents by level: Level 1 (Government-issued ID: passport, driver's license, or national ID), Level 2 (ID + selfie photo + proof of address: utility bill, bank statement, or government letter dated within 3 months), Level 3 (All Level 2 docs + source of funds documentation). All documents must be clear, unedited, and valid."}]},{id:"tyt-token",title:"TYT Token",icon:k,questions:[{id:"tyt-1",question:"What is the TYT token and what is it used for?",answer:"TYT is our native utility token built on Solana. Use cases: 1) Pay maintenance fees (20% discount), 2) Purchase miner upgrades, 3) Marketplace transactions (lower fees), 4) Governance voting (veTYT), 5) Academy course unlocks, 6) VIP tier benefits. All TYT used in the ecosystem is burned, creating deflationary pressure."},{id:"tyt-2",question:"How does the TYT burn mechanism work?",answer:"Every time TYT is used on the platform, tokens are permanently burned (removed from circulation): Maintenance payments (100% burned), Marketplace fees (50% burned), Upgrade purchases (75% burned), Weekly automated burns (from treasury). This deflationary model increases scarcity over time. View burn statistics on the TYT Trading page."},{id:"tyt-3",question:"What is veTYT and how does governance work?",answer:"veTYT (vote-escrowed TYT) is obtained by locking TYT tokens for 1 week to 4 years. Longer lock = more voting power. Vote on: 1) Discount curve adjustments, 2) Maintenance fee structure, 3) Burn schedule parameters, 4) Foundation donation percentages, 5) New feature proposals. One vote = one TYT locked for 4 years."},{id:"tyt-4",question:"Where can I buy or sell TYT tokens?",answer:"TYT can be traded on: 1) Our integrated TYT Trading page (direct swap with USDT), 2) Raydium DEX (Solana), 3) pump.fun (original listing platform). Always verify the correct contract address to avoid scams. We recommend using our platform for the best rates and security."}]},{id:"marketplace",title:"Marketplace",icon:N,questions:[{id:"mark-1",question:"How does the NFT miner marketplace work?",answer:"The marketplace lets users buy and sell NFT miners peer-to-peer. Sellers list miners with asking price (TYT), buyers browse and purchase instantly. Platform takes 2% fee (1% to Foundation, 0.5% burned, 0.5% operations). Original miner creator receives 1% royalty.
