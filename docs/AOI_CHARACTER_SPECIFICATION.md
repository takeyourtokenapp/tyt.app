## Domain Separation

### tyt.foundation
**KNOWLEDGE · SCIENCE · MEANING · ETHICS**

Content:
- Pediatric neuro-oncology
- Neuro-bio-CNS systems
- Medulloblastoma, PNET, gliomas (popular level)
- Why it's complex
- Why computing, AI, quantum, infrastructure are needed
- Whitepaper
- Partnerships
- Foundation transparency
- Real stories

**User understands "WHY"**

### takeyourtoken.app
**TOOLS · SKILLS · PRACTICE · ECONOMY**

Content:
- Crypto & Blockchain Academy
- Web3 tools
- DAO / governance (future)
- Wallet / simulation
- Smart contracts (educational)
- Proof-of-learning / Proof-of-contribution
- Foundation infrastructure
- Programmable research funding

**User learns "HOW"**

## User Journey Flow

### Child / Student

1. Enters tyt.foundation
2. Reads/watches:
   - What are CNS tumors
   - Why this is a complex problem
3. aOi says:
   > "To make such research possible, technologies are needed.
   > Want to learn how they work?"

   **Button:** "Learn Web3 tools" → takeyourtoken.app/academy

### Student (in Academy)

1. Already studying in Academy:
   - Blockchain
   - Smart contracts
   - Web3
2. aOi in lessons says:
   > "Here's an example where these tools are applied —
   > in children's brain tumor research."

   **Link back:** "See scientific context" → tyt.foundation/knowledge

### Adult / Professional

Uses:
- Web3 funds
- Transparent funding circuits

Understands:
- Where funds go
- What research is supported

Can:
- Invest
- Participate
- Check reports

## Guardian Gate System

**Flow:**

1. Child creates "student profile" (nickname, age group, no phone)
2. System requests "guardian confirmation"
3. Guardian receives link/confirmation code
4. Guardian agrees to rules (Consent form)
5. Child gets access to lessons and progress tracking

**Important:**
- Children should NOT have financial actions (donations/investments)
- Child mode shows ONLY "simulations" and "learning"
- Financial tools available ONLY in adult mode / after age verification

## Progress Ledger System

### A) Off-chain (main, convenient)

Database:
- user_id
- guardian_status (pending/approved/expired)
- course_progress (lessons/tests/points)
- achievements (badges)
- consent_logs (who/when confirmed)

### B) On-chain (only "trust anchors")

**NO personal data on blockchain**

Only:
- Achievement/certificate hash
- Timestamp
- Public "pseudo-identifier" (DID or wallet)

**Purpose:** In 5-10-15 years, person can prove:
> "Here's my certificate/portfolio, here's its hash on chain — it's authentic"

This is "for the future"

## User Growth Stages

### Stage 1: Student (under guardian)

- Learns
- Receives badges
- Does projects/essays/quizzes
- Anonymous portfolio profile

### Stage 2: University / Contributor

Does real tasks:
- Dataset curation (no PHI)
- Reproducible experiments
- Hackathons/challenges participation

Receives: Proof-of-Contribution (NFT certificates without personal data)

### Stage 3: Supporter / Investor (adult mode)

Can:
- Support foundation programs
- Participate in governance (if available)
- Invest in research (via transparent programs/funds)

## Critical Boundaries

**aOi NEVER:**
- Treats patients
- Diagnoses
- Gives medical advice
- Makes financial decisions for users
- Recommends investments
- Manages user funds

**aOi ALWAYS:**
- Explains complexity simply
- Connects science and technology
