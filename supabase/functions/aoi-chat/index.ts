• **Hash Power (TH/s)**: Higher = more rewards
• **Efficiency (W/TH)**: Lower = less electricity cost
• **Region**: Affects electricity rates
• **Maintenance**: Paid in TYT tokens (with discounts!)

Your miners work 24/7, and you can track earnings in real-time. Want to know more about a specific aspect?`;

• **Marketplace**: Buy and sell miners using TYT
• **Governance**: Vote on platform decisions with veTYT
• **Burn Mechanism**: Every transaction burns TYT, reducing supply
• **Charity**: Part of every fee supports children's brain cancer research

The more TYT you hold and use, the more benefits you unlock!`;

3. **Service Fee**: Small platform maintenance fee
